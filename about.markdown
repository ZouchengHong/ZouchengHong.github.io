About Me

Hello! I'm Zoucheng Hong, a passionate and experienced Machine Learning and Data Science Researcher. I earned my M.S. degree from Georgetown University in May 2025 , following a B.S. degree from Central University of Finance and Economics in 2023.

Since June 2025, I have been working as a Full-time Research Assistant at the [Decision Optimization Lab at ShanghaiTech University](https://sem.shanghaitech.edu.cn/jcyhsys/list.htm). In this capacity, my work primarily involves exploring the intricacies of behavioral decision science. My objective is to bridge theoretical quantitative and computational methodologies with practical applications, thereby generating tangible value in real-world contexts. Moving forward, I am committed to advancing my academic career by pursuing a PhD in a related discipline.

My academic trajectory has consistently centered on the extraction of actionable insights from complex datasets and their subsequent application to address pertinent challenges. I possess a robust mathematical foundation , which is complemented by comprehensive theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in areas such as Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Natural Language Processing, cultivated through rigorous coursework.
